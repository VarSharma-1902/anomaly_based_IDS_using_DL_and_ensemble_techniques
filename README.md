# anomaly_based_IDS_using_DL_and_ensemble_techniques

In this project, an anomaly-based intrusion detection using the deep learning and 
ensemble models is developed. <br>
By monitoring system activity and categorizing it as either normal or unusual, an 
anomaly-based intrusion detection system can detect network and computer intrusions as well 
as misuse. The classification seeks to identify any form of misuse that deviates from standard 
system operation and is based on heuristics or rules as opposed to patterns or signatures. In 
contrast, signature-based systems can only recognize attacks for which a signature has already 
been made. <br>
Deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks and deep neural networks
as well as the ensemble learning methods such as random forest classifiers and LGBM 
classifiers have been implemented on the KDD Cup99 and the NSL-KDD datasets for the
development of these systems. The performance of these models can then be compared based 
on their accuracy to classify an attack as normal or anomalous. <br><br>
